Numpy is the numerical Python for numerical computing in python.

Here are some of the things you will find in Numpy.

  1) ndarray : A efficient multidimentional array providing fast array-oriented arithmatic operation and flexiable broadcasting capability.
  2) Mathmatical function for fast operation on entire array without having to write loops
  3) Tools to reading/writing array data to the disc and working with memory-mapped files
  4) Linear Algebra, random number generator and fourier transformation
  5) A C API for connecting Numpy with liberaries written in C, C++ or FORTAN.



* Compare numpy array with python array

Code:
	import numpy as np
	my_arr = np.arange(100000)
	my_list = list(range(100000))
	
	%time for _ in range(10): my_arr2 = my_arr * 2
	%time for _ in range(10): my_list2 = [ x * 2 for x in my_list]
	
Output:
	CPU times: user 1.68 ms, sys: 486 Âµs, total: 2.17 ms
	Wall time: 1.76 ms
	CPU times: user 75.6 ms, sys: 9.98 ms, total: 85.6 ms
	Wall time: 86.4 ms
